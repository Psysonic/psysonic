// Owed-scrobble queue.
//
// A play that fails on a recoverable error is kept and retried. Unlike the star
// override in `pendingStarSync`, which this is modelled on, the queue is
// persisted: a star click can be repeated by the user, a play cannot — the user
// never sees the failure and cannot listen to the track again to produce it.
//
// Entries are keyed on the *destination* (preset + host + user), not the account
// id, so they survive the disconnect-and-reconnect that repairs a rejected
// session. One entry per (play, destination) pair: a play that reached two of
// three destinations only retries the third.
