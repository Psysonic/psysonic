 * orders the songs inside one playlist. Both surfaces here share a single
 * persisted choice, so the list reads the same wherever it appears.
 *
 * Only keys the server actually delivers in the playlist listing are offered.
 * "Last played" is deliberately absent: `play_session` records a track and a
 * timestamp but no playlist, so the database cannot say which playlist a track
 * was started from. Offering it would need a new column and a migration.
