//! Album census — reconcile the local index against the server's inventory.
//!
//! The delta only ever moves forward: it fetches what changed since a watermark
//! and skips everything below it. That makes it blind in both directions. A
//! deletion never appears in a changed-list, so it lingers until something goes
//! looking for it; and a row the ingest missed once sits below the watermark
//! forever, because nothing re-reads that range.
//!
//! Both are the same missing capability — nothing compares the two catalogues.
//! The census does, at album granularity, which is cheap enough to run on a
//! schedule: one `getAlbumList2` page run covers a whole server, and the local
//! side comes from `album_browse_projection`, which the ingest and sweep paths
//! already maintain.
//!
//! Two rules make this safe to run unattended, and they exist because the
//! resync sweep taught us what happens without them:
//!
//! 1. **Act only on a complete enumeration.** A page run that failed halfway
//!    tells us nothing about the albums it never reached. Half a census is not
//!    a census.
//! 2. **An absent album is a candidate, not a verdict.** Removal happens only
//!    after a direct `getAlbum` confirms the album is gone, and only within a
//!    cap on how much a single run may take out.
