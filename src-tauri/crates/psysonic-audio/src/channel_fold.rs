//! channels than the device wants it keeps the first few and discards the rest
//! (`ChannelCountConverter`). On a 5.1 track played through a stereo device that
//! silences centre, LFE and both surrounds — measured: of six channels only
//! front-left and front-right arrive. Whatever a mix puts in those channels is
//! simply gone, which is what issue #1408 reports.
//!
//! The gains live here rather than in the source wrapper because the spectrum
//! tap already folds the same layouts for the waveform and analyser display.
//! Sharing them keeps what is shown and what is heard on one model.
